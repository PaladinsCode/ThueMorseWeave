# ThueMorseWeave
Thueâ€“Morse weave functiog using Java

Takes a single command line argument to produce a Thue Morse weave graphic in the terminal. The built in Thue Morse array cosntructor is limited to 300 digits, however this can be extended by modifying the array size. A dyanmic array size wouldn't work as it rapidly exceded the allocated storage due to its expansion being a function of 2^n.
